# Wholething Image Picker with Fallback

FallbackImagePickerProperty is an Umbraco image picker that defines a fallback/default image that users can optionally override.

If you like this property editor you may also like [Wholething.FallbackTextProperty](https://github.com/harry-gordon/wholething-fallback-text-property).

## Use-case

The use-case for this package is simple: editors often want the option to override images/values but it is unclear what the default value is. We feel it's a significant improvement in experience for editors to be able to see the default value before deciding to override it.

## Team

This property editor is a collaboration between [Harry Gordon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hejgordon/) and Wholething ([Dean Leigh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deanleigh/?) and [Ault Nathanielsz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ault-nathanielsz-01725b13/)).

## Installation

You can find the package on NuGet: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Wholething.FallbackImagePickerProperty/

## Configuration and editor experience

When you configure an "Image Picker with Fallback" you must specify a fallback image and, optionaly, a starting node.

As an editor, users will see the default image and optionally be able to override the image.
